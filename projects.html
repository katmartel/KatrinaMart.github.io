                <p class = "description"> A web-based mentorship platform aiming to facilitate the matching process between users seeking to learn skills (Mentees) and individuals who can offer guidance in sought-after skills (Mentors). Over the duration of the Capstone project, I served as my team of four's client liaison (which entailed preparing and taking extensive notes of weekly hour long meetings with the client, then relaying this information to my team to streamline our Scrum Sprint). Built with React on the front-end, Node for the back-end, and Firebase for our database.

                <p class = "description"> Worked with one other team member to utilize HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP to create a website for UBCO's Leftovers Club as a term-long project for COSC 360 (Web Programming). We worked closely with the club's executives to ensure that our website design aligned with the club's aesthetic, and could support their need to streamline member applications as well as post and event creation. The website hosted the club's member application through a form, and once verified, allowed for logged-in members to create and edit posts as well as events. Club Admins held additional privileges to approve, view, and remove members.
