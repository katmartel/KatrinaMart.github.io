                <p>Having grown up in Northern British Columbia, my hometown’s lack of resources fostered a curiosity and desire to seek my own answers. Throughout my primary and secondary school years, I was intrigued by how the simple click of a button could modify what was displayed on the computer. This youthful inquisitiveness showcased how technology could act as my paintbrush – offering a plethora of possibilities. A continued curiosity towards technology fuelled me through my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, which allowed me to obtain the answers to questions that my hometown wasn’t equipped to provide. </p>
                <p>Unequivocally, Kitimat is where I also discovered a passion for teaching, where the opportunity to coach figure skating to children demonstrated how rewarding teaching can be.  Acting at the earliest stages of childhood growth, I’ve cherished numerous roles as an educator for young people aged widely from 3-12, since education is a powerful tool in facilitating the success of future generations.  </p>
                <p>In recent years, I have discovered that much like the feeling of creating a successful algorithm, connecting with youth and instilling a newfound passion shares a feeling that is just as parallel. This has led to my current endeavour, where I aim to fuse my passion for computer science and education to enlighten young minds to the endless possibilities that they can achieve.</p>
